# LispBM language reference

## About Symbols 

Symbols are very important and fundamental to LispBM and also perhaps 
a bit different from identifiers/names used in languages such as C, so 
a short intro could be good here. 

A symbol can be thought of as a name and can be used to give names 
to functions or values (variables). A symbol can also be treated and 
used as a value in and of itself a value (or data). So it can be used 
to name data and functions and is itself also data. 

--- 
**NOTE** 

Symbols are expressed as strings in your program such as `a`, `let`,
`define`, `+` or `orange`. The "reader", the part of LBM that parses
code, translates each symbol into a 28bit value. The string `orange`
for example is only of interest if you print a symbol and then the
runtime system will look up what string corresponds to the 28bit
identifier you want to print. So the runtime system is never wasting
time comparing strings to see if a symbol is this or that symbol, it's
all integer comparisons.

--- 

You associate values with symbols using, <a href="#define">define</a>,
<a href="#let">let</a> and you can change the value bound to a "variable" 
using <a href="#setvar">setvar</a>

Not all symbols are treated the same in LBM. Some symbols are treated as 
special because of their very fundamental nature. Among these special symbols
you find `define`, `let` and `lambda` for example. These are things that you 
should not be able to redefine and trying to redefine them leads to an error. 
There are two classes of symbols that are special by naming convention and 
these either start with a `#`, for fast-lookup variables, and `ext-` for 
extensions that will be bound at runtime.

Examples of symbols used as data are `nil` and `t`. `nil` is used the
represent nothing, the empty list or other similar things and `t`
represents true.  But any symbol can be used as data by quoting it
`'`, see <a href="#quotes-and-quasiquotation"> Quotes and
Quasiquotation </a>.


## Arithmetic

### +

Adds up an aribtrary number of values. The form of a `+` expression is
`(+ expr1 ... exprN)`

Example adding up two numbers. The result is 3.
```clj
(+ 1 2)
```
When adding up values of different types values are converted.
 ```clj
(+ 1i 3.14)
```
The example above evaluates to float value 4.14.<br>
You can add up multiple values.
```clj
(+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
```
The example above results in the value 55.

---

### -

Subtract an arbitrary number of values from a value. The form of a -
expression is `(- expr1 ... exprN)`

Example subtracting 3 from 5.
```clj
(- 5 3)
```

---

### *

Multiplying an arbitrary number of values. The form of a * expression
is `(* expr1 ... exprN)`


Example 2pi.
```clj
(* 2 3.14)
```


---

### /

Division. The form of a / expression is `(/ expr1 ... exprN)`.

Divide 128 by 2
```clj
(/ 128 2)
```
The following example evaluates to 1.
```clj
(/ 128 2 2 2 2 2 2 2)
```

---

### mod

Modulo operation. The form of a mod expression is `(mod expr1 ... exprN)`.


Compute 5 % 3, evaluates to 2.
```clj
(mod 5 3)
```


---

## Comparisons


### eq

Compare expressions for equality. The eq implements structural
equality.  The form of an eq expression is `(eq expr1 ... exprN)`


Compare the result of `(+ 1 2)` with 3. The
result of this comparison is `t`.
```clj
(eq (+ 1 2) 3)
```
Multiple expressions can be checked at once. The examples below evaluates to
`t`
```clj
(eq 1 1 1 1)

(eq (+ 3 4) (+ 2 5) (+ 1 6))
```
The following examples evaluate to `nil` representing false.
```clj
(eq 1 1 1 1 2)

(eq (+ 1 2) (+ 0 2) (+ -1 2))
```
The = comparison can be used on tree shaped data. The following expression evaluates to
`t`.
```clj
(eq '(1 (1 2)) '(1 (1 2)))
```


---

### =

The `=` operation can only be used on numerical arguments.
If you know you are comparing numbers, it will be more efficient to use
`=`.

An important difference between `eq` and `=` is
that equals compare the numerical values of the arguments. A 3 is a 3
independent of them being different types. `eq` on the other
hand compares the representations of the arguments exactly and they must
match in structure, type and value to be considered equal.


Example of `=` comparison.
```clj
(= (+ 2 3) (+ 1 4))
```


---

### >

Greater than comparison. A greater than comparison has the form `(> expr1 ... exprN)`
and evaluates to `t` if expr1 is greater than all of expr2 ... exprN.


Example
```clj
(> 5 2)
```

---

### <

Less than comparison. A less than comparison has the form `(> expr1 ... exprN)`
and evaluates to `t` if expr1 is less than all of expr2 ... exprN.


Example
```clj
(< 5 2)
```

---

### >= 

Greater than or equal comparison. A less than comparison has the form `(>= expr1 ... exprN)`
and evaluates to `t` if expr1 is greater than or equal to all of expr2 ... exprN.


Example
```clj
(>= 5 2)
```

---

### <=

Less than or equal comparison. A less than or equal comparison has the form `(<= expr1 ... exprN)`
and evaluates to `t` if expr1 is less than or equal to all of expr2 ... exprN.


Example
```clj
(<= 5 2)
```





---

## Boolean operators

### and

Boolean `and` operation between n arguments. The form
of an `and` expression is `(and expr1 ... exprN)`.
This operation treats all non-nil values as true. Boolean `and`
is "shirt-circuiting" and only evaluates until a false is encountered.


The example below evaluates to `t`
```clj
(and t t)
```
The folowing example evaluates to 3
```clj
(and t t (+ 1 2))
```
And lastly an example that evaluates to nil (for false).
```clj
(and t (< 5 3))
```


---

### or

Boolean `or` operation between n arguments. The form
of an `or` expression is `(or expr1 ... exprN)`.
This operation treats all non-nil values as true. Boolean `or`
is "short-circuiting" and only evaluates until a true is encountered.


The example below evaluates to `t`.
```clj
(or t nil)
```


---

### not

Boolean `not` takes one argument. The form of a `not`
expression is `(not expr)`. All non-nil values are considered
true.

The following example evaluates to `t`
```clj
(not nil)
```


---


## Bit level operations

### shl

The shift left operation takes two arguments. The first argument is a value to shift and the
second argument is the number of bit positions to shift the value.

The example below evaluates to 4.
```clj
(shl 1 2)
```

---

### shr

The shift right operation takes two arguments. The first argument is a value to shift and the
second argument in the number of bit positions to shift the value.

The example below evaluates to 1.
```clj
(shr 4 2)
```

---

### bitwise-and

Performs the bitwise and operation between two values. The type of the result
is the same type as the first of the arguments.

---


### bitwise-or

Performs the bitwise or operation between two values. The type of the result
is the same type as the first of the arguments.

---

### bitwise-xor

Performs the bitwise xor operation between two values. The type of the result
is the same type as the first of the arguments.

---

### bitwise-not

Performs the bitwise not operations on a value. The result is of same type as
the argument.

## Low level operations

### encode-i32

The `encode-i32` function converts a list of four (byte sized) values
into an i32 value.

Example that evaluates to the i32 value 1024.
```clj
(encode-i32 (list 0 0 4 0))
```


---

### encode-u32

The `encode-u32` function converts a list of four (byte sized) values
into an u32 value.

Example that evaluates to the u32 value 1024.
```clj
(encode-u32 (list 0 0 4 0))
```

---

### encode-float

The `encode-float` function converts a list four (byte sized) values
into a float value.

Example that evaluates to 3.14.
```clj
(encode-float (list 64 72 245 195))
```


---

### decode

The `decode` function decodes a value into a list of four (byte sized) values.

Example that decodes float 3.14 into the list (64 72 245 195).
```clj
(decode 3.14)
```

---

## nil and t

### nil

Represents the empty list. The nil value is also considered to be false by
conditionals

The example below creates a one element list by allocating a cons cell and putting a value (1) in the <a href="#car"> car </a> field
and nil in the <a href="#cdr"> cdr </a> field.
```clj
(cons 1 nil)
```

---

### t

All non nil values are considered true in conditionals. t should be used in cases where an
explicit true makes sense.

---

## Quotes and Quasiquotation

Code and data share the same representation, it is only a matter of how
you look at it. The tools for changing how your view are the quotation and
quasiquotation operations.

---

### quote

Usages of the `'` quote symbol in input code is replaced with the symbol quote
by the reader.
Evaluating a quoted expression, (quote a), results in a unevaluated.

The program string `'(+ 1 2) ` gets read into the heap as the list `(quote (+ 1 2))`.
Evaluating the expression `(quote (+ 1 2))` results in the value `(+ 1 2)`.

---

### `

The backwards tick `` ` `` is called the quasiquote. It is similar to
the `'` but allows splicing in results of computations using the <a
href="#,">,</a> and the <a href="#commaat">,\@</a> operators.


The result of `'(+ 1 2)` and `` `(+ 1 2)`` are similar in effect. Both
result in the result value of `(+ 1 2)`, that is a list containing +,
1 and 2.  When `` `(+ 1 2)`` is read into the heap it is expanded into
the expression `(append (quote (+)) (append (quote (1)) (append (quote
(2)) (quote nil))))` which evaluates to the list `(+ 1 2)`.


---

### ,

The comma is used to splice the result of a computation into a quasiquotation.

The expression `` `(+ 1 ,(+ 1 1))`` is expanded by the reader into
`(append (quote (+)) (append (quote (1)) (append (list (+ 1 1)) (quote nil))))`.
Evaluating the expression above results in the list `(+ 1 2)`.

---

### ,@

The comma-at operation is used to splice in the result of a computation (that
returns a list) into a list.

Example:
```clj
(define mylist (list 1 2 3 4 5)
`(9 6 5 ,@mylist)
```
Evaluates to the list `(9 6 5 1 2 3 4 5)`.


## Built-in operations

### eval

Evaluate data as an expression. The data must represent a valid expression.

Example that evaluates to 3.
```clj
(eval (list + 1 2))
```

---

### eval-program

Evaluate a list of data where each element represents an expression.

This function interacts with the continuation passing style
of the evaluator in a slightly non-intuitive way and should
be avoided in programs. It is used internally by the c-interoperation
code to start evaluation of newly loaded program.

If you want to evaluate a program you can always use `eval` and
put the program you wish to evaluate in a `progn` form.

---

### type-of

The `type-of` function returns a symbol that indicates what type the
argument is. The form of a `type-of` expression is `(type-of expr)`.


Example that evaluates to `type-float`.
```clj
(type-of 3.14)
```

---

### sym2str

The `sym2str` function converts a symbol to its string representation.
The resulting string is a copy of the original so you cannot destroy built in symbols using
this function.


Example that returns the string `"lambda"`.
```clj
(sym2str 'lambda)
```

---

### str2sym

The `str2sym` function converts a string to a symbol.

Example that returns the symbol `hello`.
```clj
(str2sym "hello")
```

---

### sym2u

The `sym2u` function returns the numerical value used by the runtime system
for a symbol.


Example that evaluates to 4.
```clj
(sym2u 'lambda)
```

---

### u2sym

The `u2sym` function returns the symbol associated with the
numerical value provided. This symbol may be undefined in which case you
get as result a unnamed symbol.

---

### is-fundamental

The `is-funamental` function returns true for built-in functions.

Example that returns true.
```clj
(is-fundamental '+)
```

---


## Special forms


### if

Conditionals are written as `(if cond-expr then-expr else-expr)`.
If the cond-expr evaluates to <a href="#nil"> nil </a> the else-expr will be evaluated.
for any other value of cond-expr the then-expr will be evalated.


The example below evaluates to 0 if a is less than or equal to 4. Otherwise it evaluates to a + 10.
```clj
(if (> a 4) (+ a 10) 0)
```

---

### lambda

You create an anonymous function with lambda. The function can be given a name by binding the lambda expression using <a href="#define">define</a>
or <a href="#let">let</a>. A lambda expression has the form `(lambda param-list body-expr)`.

The example shows an anonymous function that adds one.
```clj
(lambda (x) (+ x 1))
```
A lambda can be immediately applied to an argument.
```clj
((lambda (x) (+ x 1)) 10)
```
The application above results in the value 11.
Using <a href="#define"> define </a> you can give a name to the function.
```clj
(define inc (lambda (x) (+ x 1)))
```
Now the expression `(inc 10)` computes the result 11.

---

### closure

A <a href="#lambda"> lambda </a> expression evaluates into a closure which is very similar to a <a href="#lambda">lambda</a>
but extended with a captured environment for any names unbound in the param-list appearing in the body-expr.
The form of a closure is `(closure param-list body-exp environment)`.

Evaluation of the expression
```clj
(lambda (x) (+ x 1))
```
results in the value
```clj
(closure (x) (+ x 1) nil)
```
Below is an example of how a value is captured into the closure.
```clj
(let ((a 1)) (lambda (x) (+ x a)))
```
The expression above evaluates to the following. Note that `(a . 1)` appears in
the closure.
```clj
(closure (x) (+ x a) ((a . 1)))
```

---

### let

Local environments are created using let. The let binding in
lispbm allows for mutually recursive bindings. The form of a let is
`(let list-of-bindings body-expr)` and evaluating this expression
means that body-expr is evaluted in an environment extended with the list-of-bindings.

Example that evaluates to 3.
```clj
(let ((a 1)
      (b 2))
  (+ a b))
```
Below is a more advanced example of two mutually recursive functions created
in a let binding.
```clj
(let ((f (lambda (x) (if (= x 0) 0 (g (- x 1)))))
      (g (lambda (x) (if (= x 0) 1 (f (- x 1))))))
  (f 11))
```
The mutually recursive program above evaluates to 1.

---

### define

You can give names to values in a global scope by using define.
The form of define is `(define name expr)`. The expr is evaluated and it is the
result of the evaluated expr that is stored in the environment.
In lispbm you can redefine already defined values.

Example
```clj
(define apa 10)
```
---

### setvar

The `setvar` form is used to change the value of some variable in an environment.
You can use `setvar` to change the value of a global definition, a local definition
or a variable defintion (`#var`). An application of the `setvar` form looks like
`(setvar var-expr val-expr)` where `var-expr` should evaluate to a symbol. The `val-expr` is evaluated before
rebinding the variable. `setvar` returns the value that `val-expr` evaluates to.

Examples:
```clj
(define a 10)
```
The variable `a` is now `10` in the global environment.
```clj
(setvar 'a 20)
```
Now, the value of `a` will be 20. Note that `a` is quoted in the `setvar` form application
while it is not in the `define` form. This is because `define` requires the first
argument to be a symbol while the `setvar` form requires the first argument to evaluate
into a symbol.

You can also set the value of a let bound variable.
```clj
(let ((a 10)) (setvar 'a 20))
```

And you can change the value of a `#var`.

```clj
(define #a 10)

(setvar '#a 20)
```
`#a` is now 20.

---

### progn

The progn special form allows you to sequence a number of expressions.
The form of a progn expression is:
```clj
(progn expr1
       expr2
       ...
       exprN)
```
The evaluation result of a progn sequence is the value that the last `exprN`
evaluated to. This is useful for sequencing of side-effecting operations.

Simple example that evaluates to 3:
```clj
(progn 1
       2
       3)
```
An example where side effects are sequenced:
```clj
(progn (define a 10)
        (define b 20)
        (+ a b))
```
This program evaluates 30 but also extends the global environment with the
2 bindings `(a 10)` and `(b 20)` created using <a href="#define">define</a>.

---

### read

Parses a string resulting in either an expression or the <a href="#read_error">read_error</a> in case
the string can not be parsed into an expression. The form of a read expression is
`(read string)`.


The example below evaluates to the value 1:
```clj
(read "1")
```
You can also read code:
```clj
(read "(lambda (x) (+ x 1))")
```
That lambda you just read in from a string can be directly applied to an
argument if using an application of eval to evaluate the read lambda into a closure.
```clj
((eval (read "(lambda (x) (+ x 1))")) 10)
```
The code above evaluates to 11.


---

<a name="read-program"> <h3>read-program</h3> </a>

Parses a string containing multiple sequenced expressed. The resulting list of
expressions can be evaluated as a program using <a href="#eval-program">eval-program</a>.
The form of a read-program expression is `(read-program string)`.


Evaluate a program you just read from a string with <a href="#eval-program">eval-program</a>.
```clj
(eval-program (read-program "(define apa 1) (+ 2 apa)"))
```
The expression above evaluates to 3 with the side effect that the global environment
has been extended with the binding `(apa 1)`.

---


### namespace

Creates a new namespace to reduce the effect and likelyhood of colliding
names for things. Use a namespace to hold definitions that are related
to eachother. 

Namespaces in LBM form a multiply branching tree of subnamespaces. There is
a root namespace that is unnamed. Definitions in a namespaces can only be reached from a parent
namespace, not by siblings or children of that namespace. 

The example below creates a namespace as a child to the current namespace
and defines a to be 1000 within the `myspace`.
```lisp
(namespace myspace
	   (define a 1000))
```

To access `a` from the parent namespace you use a namespace "path" expressed
as symbols separated by `:`

```
# myspace:a
> 1000
```

Multiple definitions can be added to a namespace in one go by using `progn`

```lisp
(namespace loads-a-stuff
	   (progn
		(define a 1)
		(define b 2)
		(define c 3)
		(define f (lambda (x) (+ x 10)))))
```

Namespaces can be nested as:
```lisp
(namespace n1
	   (namespace n2
	   	      (define a 42)))

```

and to access `a` under n1 and n2 is done by:

```
# n1:n2:a
> 42
```

The last thing to occur in an `n1:n2: ...` sequence does not have to
be a symbols. It can be an arbitrary expression that will be evaluated in
the namespace identified by the path.

```
# n1:n2:(+ a 1000)
> 1042
```

The syntax using symbols separated by `:` (as `n1:n2:a`) expands
into applications of the `namespace` form. For example `n1:n2:a`
expands into `(namespace n1 (namespace n2 a))` upon parsing.
So the following two programs do the same thing:

```lisp
(namespace space (define stars 1000))
```

and

```lisp
space:(define stars 1000)
```

Both of the programs above defines `stars` to 1000 in the namespace `space`.
Both of the programs above also create the `space` namespace if it does not
already exist.


---
**NOTE**
Namespaces has no influence on #variables which all remain accessible from
any space.

The same is true for extensions. Extensions and #variables can be considered to
be part of some other globally available namespace.

---

---

## Lists and cons cells

Lists are build using cons cells. A cons cell is represented by the lbm_cons_t struct in the
implementation and consists of two fields named the `car` and the `cdr`.
There is no special meaning associated with the `car` and the `cdr` each can hold
a lbm_value. See <a href="#cons">cons</a> and <a href="#list">list</a> for two ways to create structures of
cons cells on the heap.

![cons cell](images/cons_cell.png?raw=true "cons cell")

A cons cell can be used to store a pair of values. You create a pair by
sticking a value in both the car and cdr field of a cons cell using either `'(1 . 2)` or
`(cons 1 2)`. 

![pair](images/pair.png?raw=true "pair")

A list is a number of cons cells linked together where the car fields hold values
and the cdr fields hold pointers (the last cdr field is nil). The list below
can be created either as `'(1 2 3)` or as `(list 1 2 3)`.

![list](images/list.png?raw=true "pair")


### car

Use `car` to access the `car` field of a cons cell. A
`car` expression has the form `(car expr)`.


Taking the `car` of a number of symbol type is in general a <a href="#type_error">type_error</a>.
The following program results in `type_error`.
```clj
(car 1)
```
The next example evaluates to 1.
```clj
(car (cons 1 2))
```
The `car` operation accesses the head element of a list. The following program evaluates to 9.
```clj
(car (list 9 8 7))
```

---

### first

`first` is an alternative (and one that makes some sense) name for the `car` operation.

Use `first` to access the first element of a list or pair. A `first` expression  has the form `(first expr)`.

```lisp
# (first (list 1 2 3 4))
> 1
```

---

### cdr

Use `cdr` to access the `cdr` field of a cons cell. A
`cdr` expression has the form `(cdr expr)`.

The example below evaluates to 2.
```clj
(cdr (cons 1 2))
```
The `cdr` operation gives you the rest of a list. The example below evaluates to the list (8 7).
```clj
(cdr (list 9 8 7))
```

---

### rest

`rest` is an alternative name for the `cdr` operation.

Use `rest` to access all elements except the first one of a list, or to access the second element in a pair. A `rest` expression has the form `(rest expr)`.

```lisp
# (rest (list 1 2 3 4))
> (2 3 4)
```

---

### cons

The `cons` operation allocates a cons cell from the heap and populates the
`car` and the `cdr` fields of this cell with its two arguments.
The form of a `cons` expression is `(cons expr1 expr2)`.

Build the list `(1 2 3)` using cons. <a href="#nil">nil</a> terminates a proper list. 
```clj
(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)))
```
Construct the pair `(+ . 1)` using cons.
```clj
(cons + 1)
```

---

### .

The dot, `.`, operation creates a pair. The form of a dot expression
is `(expr1 . expr2)`. By default the evaluator will attempt to evaluate the
result of `(expr1 . expr2)` unless it is prefixed with `'`.

Example that creates the pair (1 . 2)
```clj
'(1 . 2)
```

---

### list

The `list` function is used to create proper lists. The function
takes n arguments and is of the form `(list expr1 ... exprN)`.

Example that creates the list (1 2 3 4).
```clj
(list 1 2 3 4)
```

---

### append

The `append` function combines two lists into a longer list.
An `append` expression is of the form `(append expr1 expr2)`.

Example that combines to lists.
```clj
(append (list 1 2 3) (list 4 5 6))
```

---

### ix

Index into a list using the `ix`. the form of an `ix` expression
is `(ix list-expr index-expr)`. Indexing starts from 0 and if you index out of bounds the result is nil.

Example that evaluates to 2.
```clj
(ix (list 1 2 3) 1)
```

---

### setix

Destructively update an element in a list. The form of a `setix` expression
is `(setix list-expr index-extr value-expr)`. Indexing starts from 0 and
if you index out of bounds the result is nil.

```lisp
# (setix (list 1 2 3 4 5) 2 77)
> (1 2 77 4 5)
```

---

### setcar

The `setcar` is a destructive update of the car field
of a cons-cell.

Define `apa` to be the pair `(1 . 2)`
```clj
(define apa '(1 . 2))
```
Now change the value in the car field of apa to 42.
```clj
(setcar apa 42)
```
The `apa` pair is now `(42 . 2)`.

---

### setcdr

The `setcdr` is a destructive update of the cdr field of a cons-cell.


Define `apa` to be the pair `(1 . 2)`
```clj
(define apa '(1 . 2))
```
Now change the value in the cdr field of apa to 42.
```clj
(setcdr apa 42)
```
The `apa` pair is now `(1 . 42)`.

## Associations lists (alists) 

Association lists (alists) are, just like regular lists, built out 
of cons-cells. The difference is that an alist is a list of pairs 
where the first element in each par can be thought of as a key and 
the second element can be thought of as the value. So alists implement
a key-value lookup structure. 

`(list '(1 . horse) '(2 . donkey) '(3 . shark))` is an example 
of an alist with integer keys and symbol values. 

### acons 

The `acons` form is similar to `cons`, it attaches one more element 
onto an alist. The element that is added consists of a key and a value 
so `acons` takes one more argument than `cons`. The form of an 
`acons` expression is `(acons key-expr val-expr alist-expr)`. 
The `alist-expr` should evaluate to an alist but there are no checks 
to ensure this. 

Example that adds the key `4` and associated value `lemur` to 
an existing alist. 

```lisp
# (acons 4 'lemur (list '(1 . horse) '(2 . donkey) '(3 . shark)))
> ((4 . lemur) (1 . horse) (2 . donkey) (3 . shark))
```

---

### assoc

The `assoc` function looks up the first value in an alist matching a given a key. 
The form of an `assoc` expression is `(assoc alist-expr key-expr)`

Example that looks up the value of key `2` in an alist.
```
# (assoc (list '(1 . horse) '(2 . donkey) '(3 . shark)) 2)
> donkey
```

---


### cossa

The `cossa` function looks up the first key in an alist that matches a given value. 
The form of an `cossa` expression is `(cossa alist-expr value-expr)`

Example that looks up the key for the value `donkey` in an alist.
```
# (cossa (list '(1 . horse) '(2 . donkey) '(3 . shark)) 'donkey)
> 2
```

---

### setassoc

The `setassoc` function destructively updates a key-value mapping in an
alist. The form of a `setassoc` expression is `(setassoc alist-expr key-expr value-expr)`. 


## Arrays

### array-create

Create an array of a given type, default is an array of bytes. The 
form of an `array-create` expression is either `(array-create type size-expr)`
or `(array-create size-expr)`. If no type is specified, the default is 
to create an array of bytes. 

Currently the following types can be used for the type field:

| Type | 
| ---  | 
| type-char | 
| type-byte | 
| type-i32  |
| type-u32  | 
| type-float |
| type-i64 | 
| type-u64 |
| type-double | 

---

### array-size

Returns the size of an array in number of elements. The form 
of an `array-size` expression is `(array-size arr-expr)` where 
arr-expr has to evaluate into an array. 

---

### array-read

Read one or many elements from an array. The form of
an `array-read` expression is either `(array-read array-expr index-expr)`
of `(array-read array-expr start-index-expr end-index-expr)` for reading a range
of values into a list.

Example that evaluates to the character l.
```clj
(array-read "hello" 3)
```
The next example reads a range values
```clj
(array-read "hello" 1 3)
```
and results in the list `(\#e \#l \#l)`.

---

### array-write

The `array-write` function performs a destructive update
of an array.

Example that turns array "hello" into "heflo"
```clj
(array-write "hello" 2 \#f)
```

---

### array-clear

Clears an array by writing zeroes to all locations.

Example:

```lisp
(array-clear arr)
```

---


### Array literal syntax

Array literals can be created using the `[` and `]` syntax to enclose 
values to initialize the array with. The `[` and `]` syntax is complete
resolved in the parser and thus cannot contain arbitrary lisp terms. 
the values listed between the `[` and the `]` must be literals! 

The form of the `[` and `]` syntax is `[ type-qualifier val1 ... valN ]`
or `[ val1 ... valN]`. If no type-qualifier is specified the default is 
to create an array with byte values. 

The currently valid type qualifiers are:

| Type qualifier | 
| ---            | 
| type-byte      |
| type-i32       | 
| type-u32       | 
| type-float     | 

(The rest of the numerical types will be supported in the future) 

Example that creates a byte array 
```lisp
[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ]
```

Example that create an array of i32 values
```lisp
[ type-i32 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ]
```

---

## Pattern-matching

### match

Pattern-matching is expressed using match. The form of a match expression is
`(match expr (pat1 expr1) ... (patN exprN))`. Pattern-matching compares
the shape of an expression to each of the `pat1` ... `patN`
and evaluates the expression `exprM` of the pattern that matches.
In a pattern you can use a number of match-binders or wildcards: `_`, `?`, `?i`,`?u`,`?float`.

For example the match expression below evaluates to 2.
```clj
(match 'orange
       (green 1)
       (orange 2)
       (blue 3))
```

---

### _

The underscore pattern matches anything.


An example that evaluates to `i-dont-know`
```clj
(match 'fish
       (horse 'its-a-horse)
       (pig 'its-a-pig)
       (_ 'i-dont-know))
```

---

### ?

The `?` pattern matches anything and binds that anything to variable.
Using the `?` pattern is done as `(? var)` and the part of the expression
that matches is bound to `var`.

An example that evaluates to 19.
```clj
(match '(orange 17)
       ((green (? n)) (+ n 1))
       ((orange (? n)) (+ n 2))
       ((blue (? n)) (+ n 3)))
```

---

### ?i

The `?i` pattern matches an integer (28bit integer on 32bit platforms
and a 56bit integer on 64bit platforms) and binds that value to a
variable.  Using the ?i pattern is done as `(?i var)` and the part
of the expression that matches is bound to the `var`.

The following example evaluates to `not-an-i`.
```clj
(match 3.14
       ( (?i n) (+ n 1))
       ( _ 'not-an-i))
```
The example below evaluates to 5.
```clj
(match 4
       ( (?i n) (+ n 1))
       ( _ 'not-an-i))
```


---

### ?u

The `?u` pattern matches any unsigned and binds that value to a variable.
Using the ?u pattern is done as `(?u var)` and the part of the expression
that matches is bound to the `var`.

---

### ?float

The `?float` pattern matches any float and binds that value to a
variable.  Using the `?float` pattern is done as `(?float var)` and
the part of the expression that matches is bound to the `var`.

---

## Concurrency

### spawn

Use `spawn` to spawn a concurrent task. The concurrency implemented
by LispBM is called cooperative concurrency and it means that processes must
sleep using <a href="#yield">yield</a> or they will starve out other processes.
The form of a spawn expression is `(spawn closure arg1 ... argN)`
The return value is a process ID.

---

### wait

Use `wait` to wait for a spawned process to finish.
The argument to `wait` should be a process id.
The `wait` blocks until the process with the given process id finishes.


Be careful to only wait for processes that actually exist and do finish. Otherwise
you will wait forever.

---

### yield

To put a process to sleep, call `yield`. The argument to `yield`
is number indicating at least how many microseconds the process should sleep.

---

## Message-passing

### send

Messages can be sent to a process by using `send`. The form
of a `send` expression is `(send pid msg)`. The message, msg,
can be any LispBM value.

---

### recv

To receive a message use the `recv` command. A process
will block on a `recv` until there is a matching message in
the mailbox.
The `recv` syntax is very similar to [match](./lbmref.md#match).

Example where a process waits for an integer `?i`.
```clj
(recv ( (?i n) (+ n 1) ))
```


---

## Macros

lispBM macros are created using the `macro` keyword. A macro
is quite similar to [lambda](./lbmref.mb#lambda) in lispBM except that
arguments are passed in unevaluated. Together with the code-splicing
capabilities given by [quasiquotation](./lbmref.md#quasiquotation), this
provides a powerful code-generation tool.

A macro application is run through the interpreter two times. Once to
evaluate the body of the macro on the unevaluated arguments. The result of
this first application should be a program. The resulting program then goes
through the interpreter again to compute final values.

Given this repeated evaluation, macros are not a performance boost in
lispbm.  Macros are really a feature that should be used to invent new
programming abstractions in cases where it is ok to pay a little for
the overhead for benefits in expressivity.

### macro

The form of a `macro` expression is: `(macro args body)`

Some lisps provide a `defun` operation for defining functions
with a bit less typing. The example below defines a `defun` macro.
```clj
(define defun (macro (name args body)
                     `(define ,name (lambda ,args ,body))))
```
With this macro the function `inc` that adds 1 to its argument
can be defined as:
```clj
(defun inc (x) (+ x 1))
```

---

## Call With Current Continuation

"Call with current continuation" is called `call-cc` in LBM.
Call with current continuation saves the "current continuation", which encodes what
the evaluator will do next, into an object in the language. This encoded
continuation object behaves as a function taking one argument.


The `call-cc` should be given a function, `f`, as the single argument. This
function, `f`, should also take a single argument, the continuation.
At any point in the body of `f` the continuation can be applied to
a value, in essense replacing the entire `call-cc` with that value. All side-effecting operations
operations up until the application of the continuation will take effect.

From within a `call-cc` application it is possible to bind the continuation to a global variable
which will allow some pretty arbitrary control flow.


The example below creates a macro for a `progn` facility that
allows returning at an arbitrary point.
```clj
(define do (macro (body)
                  `(call-cc (lambda (return) (progn ,@body)))))
```
The example using `do` below makes use of `print` which is not a
built-in feature of lispBM. There are just to many different ways a programmer may
want to implement `print` on an microcontroller. Use the lispBM extensions
framework to implement your own version of `print`
```clj
(do ((print 10)
     (return 't)
     (print 20)))
```
In the example above only "10" will be printed.
Below is an example that conditionally returns.
```clj
(define f (lambda (x)
            (do ((print "hello world" \#newline)
                 (if (= x 1)
                     (return 't)
                     nil)
                 (print "Gizmo!" \#newline)))))
```

## Unparsable symbols

Unparsable symbols cannot be written into a program. The unparsable symbols
signals different kinds of error conditions that may point at something
being wrong in the code (or that it is exhausting all resources).

### no_match

The `no_match` symbol is returned from pattern matching if
no case matches the expression. 

    - Add a catch-all case to your pattern-matching. `_`. 

---

### read_error

The `read_error` symbol is returned if the reader cannot
parse the input code.

Read errors are most likely caused by syntactically incorrect input programs.

    - Check that all opening parenthesis are properly closed.

---

### type_error

The `type_error` symbol is returned by built-in functions or extensions
if the values passed in are of incompatible types.

---

### eval_error

The `eval_error` symbol is returned if evaluation could
not proceed to evaluate the expression. This could be because the
expression is malformed.

Evaluation error happens on programs that may be syntactically correct
(LispBM has a very low bar for what is considered syntactically correct),
but semantically nonsensical.

    - Check the program for mistakes.
    - Are your parenthesis enclosing the correct subterms?
    - Check that you haven't written, for example, (1 + 2) where it should be (+ 1 2).

---

### out_of_memory

The `out_of_memory` symbol is returned if the heap is full and running
the garbage collector was not able to free any memory up. 

The program you have written requires more memory.

    - Increase the heap size.
    - Rewrite the application to use less memory.

---

### fatal_error

The `fatal_error` symbol is returned in cases where the
LispBM runtime system cannot proceed. Something is corrupt and it is
not safe to continue.

    - If this happens please send the program and the full error message
      to blog.joel.svensson@gmail.com. It will be much appreciated.

---

### out_of_stack

The `out_of_stack` symbol is returned if the evaluator
runs out of continuation stack (this is its runtime-stack). You are
most likely writing a non-tail-recursive function that is exhausting all
the resources.

    - Check your program for recursive functions that are not tail-recursive
      Rewrite these in tail-recursive form.
    - If you spawned this process in a small stack. For example (spawn 10 prg),
      try to spawn it with a larger stack.

---

### division_by_zero

The `division_by_zero` symbol is returned when dividing by zero.

    - Check your math.
    - Add 0-checks into your code at a strategic position.

---

### variable_not_bound

The `variable_not_bound` symbol is returned when evaluating a
variable (symbol) that is neighter bound nor special (built-in function).
